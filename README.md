Introduction


The thirst for learning, upgrading technical skills and applying the concepts in real life environment at a fast pace is what the industry demands from IT professionals today. However busy work schedules, far-flung locations, and unavailability of convenient time-slots pose as major barriers when it comes to applying the concepts into realism. And hence the need to look out for alternative means of implementation in the form of laddered approach.

The above truly pose as constraints especially for our students too! With their busy schedules, it is indeed difficult for our students to keep up with the genuine and constant need for integrated application which can be seen live especially so in the field of IT education where technology can change on the spur of a moment. Well, technology does come to our rescue at such times!!

Keeping the above in mind and in tune with our constant endeavour to use Technology in our training model, we at Aptech have thought of revolutionizing the way our students learn and implement the concepts using tools themselves by providing a live and synchronous eProject learning environment!

So what is this eProject?

eProject is a step by step learning environment that closely simulates the classroom and Lab based learning environment into actual implementation. It is a project implementation at your fingertips!! An electronic, live juncture on the machine that allows you to

o	Practice step by step i.e. laddered approach. o Build a larger more robust application.
o  Usage of certain utilities in applications designed by user.
o Single program to unified code leading to a complete application. o Learn implementation of concepts in a phased manner.
o Enhance skills and add value. o Work on real life projects.
o Give a real life scenario and help to create applications more complicated and useful.
o  Mentoring through email support.


How do we start accessing the Sample eProject?

The students at the centre are expected to complete this eProject and send complete documentation with source code within the time allotted to eProjects Team

Looking forward to a positive response from your end!!
 

Objectives of the project


The Objective of this program is to give a sample project to work on real life projects. These applications help you build a larger more robust application.


The objective is not to teach you the software s but to provide you with a real life scenario and help you create basic applications using the tools.

You can revise the topics before you start with the project.

These programs should be done in the Lab sessions with assistance of the faculty if required.

It is very essential that a student has a clear understanding of the subject.

Kindly get back to eProjects Team in case of any doubts regarding the application or its objectives.
 
Problem Statement

Introduction

Our client is a doctor who is one of the famous Cardiac specialists in the country. As he is one of the famous specialists in the country, he generally used to visit some places for operating some patients with some critical cardiac conditions. Also he used to get invitations from various colleges in the country for attending and giving the seminars, also he runs a college, which is one of the famous Medical colleges in the country.

Actually he wants an online application such as a discussion forum for the doctors in the world, so that if any one is having any queries (for the junior doctors, etc.) or to discuss some new cases in different fields. He wants this application to be developed as this can bridge the gap between the various doctors available in the world and can know each other through this portal. Also in case of any emergencies or for some special cases one can go through the application and search for the various doctors based on the specialization and the location which ever is suitable so that so many people s lives can be saved.

Customer Expectations

The customer wants the application to include the following tasks.
o	There should be a logo common to all the pages of the application, and all the
pages should include the symbol of the cross, as a back ground.
o	Through the application one can register online, contact each other through

the form where one can post a query and the other can reply.
o	On the home page, the number of users registered (count) and the number of

users logged (count) in are to be displayed at the top corner of the page.
o	Also a pop up window is to be displayed where ever necessary like if a user

registers or if the user enters a wrong password, etc.
o	As soon as a user registers for the website, the details of the users registered should be counted.

o	There should be an option for the registered users, where his account can be made viewable based on public or private, i.e., if the user don t want to share

his contact details, then he can chose the profile to be private, else he can chose the profile to be public.

o	The details should include the contact details, personal, professional, qualification, experience, and as well the achievement details.
o	The Advanced search option is to be included that includes the location, specialization, and as well it can also include the experience.
o	There should be separate login for the admin and as well the users.
o	The users should only be able to can update his / her a/c., access the details, i.e., can only retrieve the details of the other doctors or users, post a query or
a request, reply to a query or suggest
o	The Administrator, will have the right of removing or deleting the user.
 
Standards plan:

Every code block must have comments.

The logic of the program needs to be explained. Proper documentation should be maintained.
Complete Project Report along with synopsis, code and documentation should be prepared.

Documentation:

No project is complete without documentation. In fact, it is one of the most important activities during the development of a project. The documentation of an ideal project will be in the form of a project report comprising of the following documents:

Certificate of Completion.


Table of Contents.


Problem Definition.


Customer Requirement Specification.


Project Plan.


E-R Diagrams.


Algorithms.


GUI Standards Document.


Interface Design Document.


Task Sheet.


Project Review and Monitoring Report.


Unit Testing Check List.


Final Check List.

 
Deliverables



You need to submit the following Deliverables:


a)	Send us two eProjects status mails, each should be after 10 days interval from your eProjects start date.

b)	The status mail should consist of description with review document (what's going on the project). Also you can send your doubts / clarification or any additional inputs required to complete your eproject any time during the project planning and execution.

c)	At the time of project submission also send us the feedback along

with your documentation (soft copy). The Feedback form is attached with this mail.


Remember that the subject of your email should start either with the word STATUS:
